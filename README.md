# Datatype Extensions

Examples and prototypes for approaches to extending python support for the [FHIR primitive types](http://build.fhir.org/datatypes.html#primitive).  This
repository draws upon:

* [PyJSG](https://github.com/hsolbrig/pyjsg) -- a pre-dataclass implementation of strong(er) typing in Python
* [Biolinkml](https://github.com/biolink/biolinkml) -- another python code generator (amongst other things) that includes strong typing
* [funowl](https://github.com/hsolbrig/funowl) -- a nascent Python OWL Functional implementation

We anticipate that this repository will be absorbed in the [Python FHIR Client](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/client-py/) implementation in the not too distant future
